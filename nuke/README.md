An attempt to create a program to safely delete files using "Secure-Delete".
This can obviously be done within a terminal but I was curious how to execute scripts or other programs from a c program.
I wanted to experiment to see if I could compile a c program which had all dependencies covered to resemble a single file to use on Windows.

*NOT EVEN CLOSE TO DONE!*
